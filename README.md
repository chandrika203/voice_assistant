# 🎙️ My Personal Voice Assistant – Powered by GROQ & Streamlit

This project is an interactive **Voice Assistant** application built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **GROQ’s LLaMA 3.3 70B** model. It listens to your voice, processes your query using an LLM, and speaks back like a South Indian movie character (inspired by **Brahmanandam garu** 🎬).
